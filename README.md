# Fraud Detection Model

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on fraud detection in transactional datasets. The model is built using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, and the Random Forest model was selected for deployment based on its overall accuracy.

## Project Overview
Fraud detection is critical in financial systems to mitigate potential losses and improve security. This project aims to predict fraudulent transactions accurately by building and evaluating different machine learning models.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Models Used**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree 
  - Random Forest (Selected for overall model performance) (Deployed Model)
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handled imbalanced target variable using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Recall Score
  - Precision
  - F1 Score
- **Deployment**:
  - The Random Forest model has been deployed.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of transaction records credit card used in The US with multiple features indicative of fraudulent activities.
