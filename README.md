# Fraud Detection Model

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on fraud detection in transactional datasets. The model is built using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, and the Random Forest model was selected for deployment based on its overall accuracy.

## Project Overview
Fraud detection is critical in financial systems to mitigate potential losses and improve security. This project aims to predict fraudulent transactions accurately by building and evaluating different machine learning models.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Models Used**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree 
  - Random Forest (Selected for overall model accuracy) (Deployed Model)
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handled imbalanced target variable using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Recall Score (primary focus)
  - Precision
  - F1 Score
  - Accuracy
- **Deployment**:
  - The Random Forest model has been deployed.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of transaction records with multiple features indicative of fraudulent activities.


## Results
- The Decision Tree model outperformed Logistic Regression and Random Forest in terms of recall score.
- Random Forest performed well in terms of overall model accuracy.
- SMOTE was used to balance the target variable, improving model performance.
- Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations are provided in the notebook.
